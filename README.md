## Log
On October 11, we came up with a fun idea to compute the best fit course schedules in order to ease students' life in Grinnell. However, the actual development was postponed for different reasons until October 23.

GunWoo designed a recursive backtracking approach to generate every possible course combination with no time conflicts. To allow the courses inside the school database to be used by the program, a specific data structure had to be made. This was handled by Rhys, who was responsible for the data structures used by the program. While this was going on, Samuel proposed to display them according to user preference, including or excluding certain sections. Which was implemented by Rhys and Samuel. While GunWoo and Rhys developed the program, Samuel designed and made the website using Flask. After the program was developed, Samuel, GunWoo, and Rhys made further changes to the website for improving the user experience.
